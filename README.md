# Obsidian Antidote Plugin

This is a plugin that integrates [Antidote](https://antidote.info) with Obsidian. Simply install and the plugin, and then use the "Correct with Antidote" command to open the selected text in Antidote.

This code is largely based on [Druide](mailto:assistance_integration@druide.com)'s sample Visual Studio Code for integration with the Connectix Agent. In fact, the `Antidote/` folder is copied from it, except for the VSCode APIs, which where replaced with their closest Obsidian equivalent.
